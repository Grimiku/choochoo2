- Add a bridge from Lisboa to Leiria
- Only allow one connection to Lisboa per turn
- Add an extra claimable spot between Lisboa and Acores (I might just want to squeeze in an extra piece of track)
- Allow multiple users to claim the same track (and all the messed up implications of that)
- Add river textures
- Add rules
